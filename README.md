# MLAlgorithms

As I endevour through the depths of Machine Learning, I found that the best way to understand Machine Learning algorithms was to implement them. With that being said, I have implemented various Machine Learning Algorithms in this repository for my own learning purposes. Since I have included a basic implementation of a 3 Layer Neural Network, it is safe to say that I have compiled implementations of Deep Learning Algorithms as well. However, this repository houses implementations of powerful Machine Learning Algorithms.   
I had a blast implementing these algorithms ,and I hope you enjoy!  

Just a quick note, all the datasets that were used can be found in the Machine Learning by Andrew Ng Course on Coursera. Furthermore, all the datasets have been preprocessed beforehand and therefore I will not need to preprocess them (besides normalizing them for Gradient Descent). With that being said, the best approach has already been identified ,and I am merely implementing the algorithms for understanding. However, if you were to use these algorithms for a different raw dataset, you will need to carry out the Machine Learning process.
