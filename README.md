# MLAlgorithms

As I endevour through the depths of Machine Learning, I found that the best way to understand Machine Learning algorithms was to implement them. With that being said, I have implemented various Machine Learning Algorithms in this repository for my own learning purposes. Since I have included a basic implementation of a 3 Layer Neural Network, it is safe to say that I have compiled implementations of Deep Learning Algorithms as well. However, this repository houses implementations of powerful Machine Learning Algorithms.  
I had a blast implementing these algorithms ,and I hope you enjoy!
